# The Guardian Legend Setup Guide

## Required Software

- The BizHawk emulator. Versions 2.3.1 and higher are supported.
    - [BizHawk at TASVideos](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk)
- Your legally acquired US release ROM file for The Guardian Legend.

## Installation Procedures

1. Download and install the latest version of Archipelago.
    - On Windows, download Setup.Archipelago.<HighestVersion\>.exe and run it.
2. Assign EmuHawk version 2.3.1 or higher as your default program for launching `.nes` files.
    - Extract your BizHawk folder to your Desktop, or somewhere you will remember. Below are optional additional steps
       for loading ROMs more conveniently.
        1. Right-click on a ROM file and select **Open with...**
        2. Check the box next to **Always use this app to open .nes files**.
        3. Scroll to the bottom of the list and click the grey text **Look for another App on this PC**.
        4. Browse for `EmuHawk.exe` located inside your BizHawk folder (from step 1) and click **Open**.
3. (EmuHawk version ≤ 2.8) Go to Config > Customize. Switch to the Advanced tab, then switch the Lua Core from "NLua+KopiLua" to
  "Lua+LuaInterface". Then restart EmuHawk. This is required for the Lua script to function correctly.
  **NOTE: Even if "Lua+LuaInterface" is already selected, toggle between the two options and reselect it. Fresh installs** 
  **of newer versions of EmuHawk have a tendency to show "Lua+LuaInterface" as the default selected option but still load** 
  **"NLua+KopiLua" until this step is done.**

## Create a Config (.yaml) File

### What is a config file and why do I need one?

See the guide on setting up a basic YAML at the Archipelago setup
guide: [Basic Multiworld Setup Guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)

### Where do I get a config file?

The Player Settings page on the website allows you to configure your personal settings and export a config file from
them. Player settings page: [The Guardian Legend Player Settings Page](/games/The%20Guardian%20Legend/player-settings)

### Verifying your config file

If you would like to validate your config file to make sure it works, you may do so on the YAML Validator page. YAML
validator page: [YAML Validation page](/check)

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

### Obtain your patch file and create your ROM

When you join a multiworld game, you will be asked to provide your config file to whoever is hosting. Once that is done,
the host will provide you with either a link to download your patch file, or with a zip file containing everyone's patch
files. Your patch file should have a `.aptgl` extension.

Put your patch file on your desktop or somewhere convenient, and double click it. This should automatically launch the
client, and will also create your ROM in the same place as your patch file.


## Running the Client Program and Connecting to the Server

Once the Archipelago server has been hosted:

1. Navigate to your Archipelago install folder and run `ArchipelagoBizhawkClient.exe`.
2. Notice the `/connect command` on the server hosting page. (It should look like `/connect archipelago.gg:*****`
   where ***** are numbers)
3. Type the connect command into the client OR add the port to the pre-populated address on the top bar (it should
   already say `archipelago.gg`) and click `connect`.

### Running Your Game and Connecting to the Client Program

1. Open EmuHawk 2.3.1 or higher and load your ROM OR click your ROM file if it is already associated with the
   extension `*.nes`.
2. Navigate to where you installed Archipelago, then to `data/lua`, and drag+drop the `connector_bizhawk.lua` script onto
   the main EmuHawk window.
    1. You could instead open the Lua Console manually, click `Script` 〉 `Open Script`, and navigate to
       `connector_bizhawk.lua` with the file picker.
    2. If it gives a `NLua.Exceptions.LuaScriptException: .\socket.lua:13: module 'socket.core' not found:` exception
       close your emulator entirely, restart it and re-run these steps.
    3. If it says `Must use a version of BizHawk 2.3.1 or higher`, double-check your BizHawk version by clicking **
       Help** -> **About**.

## Play the game

When the client shows both NES and server are connected, you are good to go. You can check the connection status of the
NES at any time by running `/nes`.

### Other Client Commands

All other commands may be found on the [Archipelago Server and Client Commands Guide.](/tutorial/Archipelago/commands/en)
.

## Known Issues

- This mod is currently under development, so expect bugs and issues, though most games should be fullt completable without issue.
- Because some items are always handled by the AP server, randomized TGL games can't be played without a connection to the AP server.
- There is no save system, and passwords are not supported in conjunction with AP (item handling will be messed up), 
   so use savestates to save progress when needed. The TGL password is also not supported and will have unexpected effects.
